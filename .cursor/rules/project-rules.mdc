# Ultimate Cursor Rules for TypeScript Projects

> A single, opinionated `.mdc` ruleset that consolidates project rules you've already built across projects (`project-rules.mdc`, `commit.mdc`, `scripts.mdc`, `user_rules.md`, etc.) and fills the most useful gaps for an autonomous coding agent.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document is the canonical ruleset for **TypeScript projects** managed by the team and enforced by tooling/agents. It:

* **Consolidates** the project's existing rules across other `.mdc` files you provided.
* **Defines** behaviour expected from coding agents (local LLM helpers, CI bots, automation agents).
* **Provides** concrete templates and examples to reduce ambiguity.

**Scope:** all TypeScript/React services, frontend apps, shared libraries, scripts, CI pipelines and developer automation. Non-TS projects should follow the spirit of this doc where applicable.

---

## 2. How to use this file (humans & agents)

* **Humans:** Read top-level sections relevant to your change. Follow the templates in section 19 when opening PRs or commits.
* **Agents:** Treat this file as *executable policy*. When performing code changes, generate code + tests + script usage + commit messages that adhere to the rules. If the agent cannot fully comply it must document assumptions and open a draft PR.

**Always include** a small header in automated outputs with `timestamp` and `path` (see Templates section).

---

## 3. Documentation-First Rule

* Always consult the official documentation for any language, library or API used before making a decision or writing code. Prefer official docs over blogs.
* **Required references** in PRs and code comments for non-trivial logic:

  * TypeScript: `https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/`
  * MDN: JavaScript reference
  * React: official React docs

Agent behavior: before assuming behavior of an API, include the doc link you used and a one-line quote (<= 25 words) when the change relies on it.

---

## 4. Architecture & Project Structure

**Layered architecture (backend-like projects)**

* `controller` / `routes` - HTTP surface. No business logic.
* `service` - Business logic.
* `repository` / `db` - Data access.
* `model` / `entities` - Domain models.
* `dto` - Data transfer objects (immutable where appropriate).

**Frontend / React structure**

* `components/` - UI components (one component per file)
* `hooks/` - custom hooks
* `features/<feature>/` - feature folders (component, styles, tests, types)
* `lib/` - shared utilities
* `pages/` or `routes/` - route-level components (if applicable)

**General rules**

* Prefer feature grouping over technical grouping for larger apps.
* Use `index.ts` only to re-export a small module surface.
* Keep files under \~300 LOC. If larger, split logic into helpers.

---

## 5. TypeScript & JavaScript Rules

**Compiler options (recommended `tsconfig.json` base)**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

**Typing rules**

* `noAny`: avoid `any`. If unavoidable, use `unknown + type guards` and justify in code comment.
* Prefer `interface` for public shapes, `type` for unions & utility types.
* Use TypeScript utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Readonly`, `Record`) rather than ad-hoc `any`.
* **Naming:**

  * Interfaces: `I{Name}` (PascalCase with `I` prefix). ✅ (project rule)
  * Types/Aliases: `T{Name}` (PascalCase with `T` prefix). ✅
  * Components: `PascalCase`
  * Variables & functions: `camelCase`
  * Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

**Imports & ordering**

* Group imports in this order: `react` (if present) → third-party → absolute aliases → relative (`../` then `./`).
* Alphabetize within groups.

**Runtime checks**

* For external data (HTTP, DB), always validate/sanitize input and use type guards or schema validators (zod/yup/ajv).

---

## 6. React / Frontend Rules

* Use **functional components with hooks**. Avoid class components.
* Keep components focused (single responsibility). Extract complex logic into hooks or helpers.
* Keep state as local as possible. Use Context/Zustand/Redux only when needed.
* Performance patterns: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` for expensive calculations; virtualization for long lists.
* Accessibility: follow basic a11y checks — semantic HTML, proper `aria-*` attributes, keyboard navigation.

---

## 7. Clean Code & Naming Conventions

* Use clear, expressive names; prefer verbs for functions.
* No redundant comments — code should explain itself. Use comments to explain *why*, not *what*.
* Avoid dead code. Remove unused functions and imports.
* Keep consistent formatting (Prettier) and linting (ESLint).
* SRP: If a function/class does more than one thing, refactor.

---

## 8. Dependency Injection & Patterns

* Prefer constructor injection for classes that require dependencies.
* Avoid global mutable singletons unless necessary.
* Use explicit interfaces for external dependencies to make testing easier.

---

## 9. Testing & Quality Gates

* Use `Jest` + `@testing-library/react` for unit tests and component tests.
* Add integration tests where appropriate (e.g., database interactions).
* Minimum recommended coverage threshold: **80%** (raise per project risk).
* Use `@testing-library` to test behavior (not implementation details).
* Test file naming conventions:

  * Unit: `*.unit.test.ts` or `*.test.ts`
  * Integration: `*.integration.test.ts`
  * E2E: placed under `tests/e2e/`

**CI must run:** lint → build → test → quality checks.

---

## 10. Scripts & Terminal Rules (Scripts Priority)

**Main rule:** ALWAYS use scripts in `/scripts/` for terminal operations. Prefer `./scripts/dev.sh <command>`.

**Priority commands (examples):**

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh start    # start application
./scripts/dev.sh dev      # dev shell
./scripts/dev.sh build    # build project
./scripts/dev.sh test     # run tests
./scripts/dev.sh quality  # run lint/static analysis
./scripts/dev.sh logs     # view logs
./scripts/dev.sh stop     # stop services
./scripts/dev.sh clean    # clean workspace
```

**Never use direct commands in automation or agents** unless those scripts don't exist, and this fallback must be documented in the PR.

**Agent rule:** If an agent must run terminal work, it must prefer script calls and include the exact command used in the PR description.

---

## 11. Commit, PR & Release Rules

**Commit message format:** Angular commit convention (strict):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Allowed types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.

**Scope suggestions:** `auth`, `users`, `profile`, `transactions`, `categories`, `goals`, `reports`, `api`, `db`, `config`, `security`, `ui`, `test`, `docs`, `scripts`, `deps`.

**Subject rules:** imperative, lower-case start, max 50 chars, no trailing period.

**Body rules:** explain what and why, not how. Lines <= 72 chars.

**Footer:** reference issues, breaking changes, release notes.

**Pre-commit hooks & validation**

* Use `commitlint` + Husky to enforce commit message format.
* Run `npm run lint:fix` and tests before allowing commit (via husky pre-commit hooks).

**PR rules**

* Branch name: `<type>/<scope>-short-desc` (e.g., `feat/transactions-add-reconciliation`).
* PR title: same format as single commit subject for small PRs. If multiple commits, pick a clear summary.
* Minimum one approving reviewer for non-trivial changes; two reviewers for security/critical modules.
* PR Checklist (must be ticked):

  * [ ] Tests added/updated
  * [ ] Lint and build pass
  * [ ] Commits follow commit rules (use `npx commitlint --from <base> --to <head>`)
  * [ ] Scripts used where applicable
  * [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
  * [ ] README.md updated if behavior changed
  * [ ] Documentation kept in sync with code changes

**Merge rules**

* Use `Squash and merge` for small, single-purpose PRs, otherwise `Rebase & merge` when preserving commits matters.
* No direct pushes to `main` or protected branches. No force-push on protected branches.

**Release**

* Use semantic-release or manual changelog flows driven from commit messages.

---

## 12. CI / CD and Automation

**CI pipeline must include:**

1. `setup` (node install, environment)
2. `lint` (ESLint + TypeScript typecheck)
3. `build` (production build)
4. `test` (unit + integration) + coverage report
5. `quality` (static analysis, vulnerability scan)

**Optional (recommended):**

* Dependency update bot (Dependabot/renovate) configured with PR templates and tests.
* SAST / secrets scan (e.g., GitHub CodeQL, Snyk) on PRs.
* Publish artifacts (Docker images, NPM packages) only from protected pipeline steps.

---

## 13. Database & Migrations

* Use Flyway / Prisma / TypeORM migrations with versioned scripts.
* Place migrations in `src/db/migrations` or `db/migration`.
* Migration file naming: `V{version}__{short_description}.sql`.
* Test migrations in a disposable environment before applying to staging/production.

---

## 14. Security & Secrets

* Never hardcode secrets. Load secrets from environment variables or a secrets manager.
* Add secrets scanning in CI. Block PRs that leak credentials.
* Validate input thoroughly to avoid injection.
* Use HTTPS and secure cookie attributes.

---

## 15. Performance, Monitoring & Observability

* Add basic metrics and health endpoints in backend services.
* Use logging standards (structured logs, include correlation IDs).
* Add performance budgets for frontend bundles.
* Monitor common regression signals: cold-start latency, critical path render time, DB query p95/99.

---

## 16. Accessibility, i18n & Openness

* Provide accessible UI components (semantic HTML + ARIA where necessary).
* Plan for i18n from start for multi-language projects (strings extraction, locale fallback).
* Respect OSS licenses for third party code and declare license in repo.

---

## 17. Agent-specific rules (WHAT an automation/coding agent MUST do)

This section defines mandatory behavior for any coding agent operating on this repository.

1. **Documentation-first:** Before making changes, list the official docs consulted. Embed one-line justification.
2. **Use scripts:** call `./scripts/dev.sh ...` for any local operations. If script not present, suggest a script and add it to the PR.
3. **Commit conventions:** produce commit messages that follow Angular rules. If multiple changes, squash logical changes into coherent commits.
4. **Generate tests:** for any functional change, the agent must include unit tests (and integration tests when DB or network behavior is affected).
5. **Run local checks:** run `lint`, `build`, `test` and include a CI log (or summary) in the PR description (timestamp + commands used).
6. **Explain assumptions:** if any behavior is guessed, the agent must add a `ASSUMPTIONS.md` section in the PR describing them.
7. **No direct main pushes:** always create a branch and a PR; never push directly to protected branches.
8. **Security checks:** run a dependency vulnerability scan and include the results in PR; if a high severity issue appears, block the PR and propose remediation.
9. **PR Templates & Checklist:** fill required checkboxes automatically when actions are performed.
10. **Documentation updates:** ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md and README.md when making any changes to the application, scripts, configuration, or functionality. Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
11. **Ask only when necessary:** prefer making a best-effort implementation and document the choices rather than stalling — include the steps a human must validate.

---

## 18. Enforcement & Automation

**Automated gates**

* Pre-commit: Prettier -> ESLint autofix -> Type-check -> Tests (fast subset)
* CI: full lint -> type-check -> build -> test -> coverage -> security scans
* PR protection: must pass CI + at least 1 reviewer

**Tooling suggestions**

* `ESLint` with `@typescript-eslint` rules
* `Prettier` for formatting
* `Husky` + `lint-staged` for pre-commit hooks
* `Commitlint` for commit message policy
* `Dependabot` or `Renovate` for dependency updates
* `Snyk` / `CodeQL` for security scanning
* `semantic-release` for automated changelogs & releases

---

## 21. Changelog / Versioning this ruleset

* Version this file using semantic version notes at the top of the file when updates are made.
* Use Git tags on the ruleset repo if maintained separately.

---

## Final notes & Ownership

* The rules collected here are intentionally opinionated to drive consistency and automation.
* If a rule has an operational cost (e.g., raising coverage to 95%), discuss in a PR and propose a phased rollout.
* **Owner**: the project tech lead or `#engineering-guidelines` team channel (update this line to match project reality).

---

*This `.mdc` consolidates the rules you provided and expands them with agent-focused behavior, CI checks, and templates. Update this file as processes evolve.*
