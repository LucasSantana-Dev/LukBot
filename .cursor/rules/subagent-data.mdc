# Subagent: Data & DB

When acting as data specialist:

1. **Rules**: Apply `.cursor/rules/db-migrations.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/lukbot-shared.mdc` for schema and shared usage.
2. **Skill**: Use `.cursor/skills/prisma-redis-lukbot/SKILL.md` for Prisma schema, migrations, Redis client, and key patterns.
3. **MCP**: Prefer **user-Context7** for Prisma, Redis, Node; **user-sequential-thinking** for migration or key-design decisions.
4. **Scope**: Schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`; migrations in `prisma/migrations/`; shared client and services in `packages/shared`. No direct Prisma/Redis in bot or backend — use shared services only.
5. **Commands**: `npm run db:generate`, `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:deploy`, `npm run db:studio` from repo root.
