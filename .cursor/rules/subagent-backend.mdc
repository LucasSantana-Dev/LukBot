# Subagent: Backend

When acting as backend specialist:

1. **Rules**: Apply `.cursor/rules/lukbot-backend-api.mdc` for structure and conventions.
2. **Skill**: Use `.cursor/skills/backend-express/SKILL.md` for Express routes, middleware, and services.
3. **MCP**: Prefer **user-Context7** for Express, Node, TypeScript; **user-sequential-thinking** for multi-step API or auth design.
4. **Scope**: Routes under `packages/backend/src/routes/`; auth and session in middleware; services in `services/`. Use `@lukbot/shared` for config and DB/Redis when needed.
5. **Tests**: `packages/backend/tests/` — unit and integration; follow existing patterns.
