## Architecture

```
packages/
  shared/      # Types, services, config, Prisma client (base dependency)
  bot/         # Discord.js 14 bot (slash commands, events, music)
  backend/     # Express 5 API server (auth, routes, sessions)
  frontend/    # React 19 + Vite dashboard (Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, Zustand)
```

**Build order**: shared → bot | backend | frontend (parallel)

### Design System
- Main colors:
  - Lucky Purple (primary): `#8b5cf6`
  - Lucky Gold (accent): `#d4a017`
- Brand palette: purple-dominant surfaces with gold highlights.
- Typography:
  - Display: `Sora`
  - Body/UI: `Manrope`
  - Mono/technical: `JetBrains Mono`
- Semantic UI foundation:
  - Tokens: `--lucky-surface-*`, `--lucky-text-*`, `--lucky-motion-*`,
    `--lucky-shadow-*` in `packages/frontend/src/index.css`
  - Primitives: `Shell`, `SectionHeader`, `EmptyState`, `StatTile`,
    `ActionPanel` in `packages/frontend/src/components/ui`

### Discord Discovery Media
- Discovery carousel media is stored at
  `assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final` and should be referenced from
  `main` branch raw URLs for long-term stability:
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky/main/assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final/01-auth-control.png`
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky/main/assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final/02-server-management.png`
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky/main/assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final/03-feature-suite.png`
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky/main/assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final/04-navigation-loop.gif`
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky/main/assets/discord-discovery-media/2026-03/final/05-live-control-loop.gif`

### Latest Release (`v2.6.13`)
- Fixed production backend crash-loop caused by
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` on shared deep imports.
- Added wildcard shared exports for `@lucky/shared/services/*` to keep backend
  runtime imports stable.
- Added CI regression guard (`npm run verify:shared-exports`) after
  `build:shared`.
- Added homelab diagnostics helper (`scripts/homelab-diagnostics.sh`) for fast
  deploy smoke incident triage.

## Features

### Bot
- Multi-platform music (YouTube, Spotify) with queue, shuffle, repeat, lyrics, autoplay
- Dynamic Discord presence rotation with live guild/member/session stats and command CTA
- Autoplay recommendations use anti-repeat filtering with queue buffering so shuffle stays useful during autoplay
- Autoplay command recovers active guild queue from player cache fallback to avoid false queue-missing errors during active playback
- Now-playing card updates in place to avoid channel spam on track changes
- Video/audio downloads with format selection and progress tracking
- Moderation: warn, mute, kick, ban with case tracking
- Auto-mod: word filter, link filter, spam detection
- Custom commands, embed builder, auto-messages (welcome/leave)
- Reaction roles, role management
- Centralized guild automation (`/guildconfig`) with manifest capture, drift plans,
  reconcile/apply flows, and cutover checklist tracking
- Guild automation API apply/reconcile now execute real mutation runs
  (`capture -> plan -> apply`) with persisted run outcomes (`completed`,
  `blocked`, `failed`)
- Guild automation reconciliation uses ID-first mapping with deterministic
  fallback (role/channel keys) and persists remapped manifest IDs to prevent
  repeated create/delete drift loops
- Twitch stream notifications (EventSub WebSocket)
- Last.fm scrobbling integration

### Dashboard
- Discord OAuth authentication
- Guild management with bot status
- Neo-editorial shell with responsive sidebar and contextual page framing
- Dashboard, Servers, and Last.fm pages aligned to shared status/empty-state primitives
- Module/command toggle per server
- Guild RBAC by Discord role (`view`/`manage`) with hybrid fallback:
  owners/admin/manage-server users keep baseline access when grants are absent,
  while role grants control non-admin module access
- `/servers` remains available to authenticated users even when module-level
  access is restricted, so server discovery/invite flows stay reachable
- Sidebar identity resolution chain: `nick > globalName > username`
- Dashboard guild metrics now use live bot/API counts, rendering unknown values
  as `—` instead of `0`
- Moderation case viewer and settings
- Auto-mod configuration
- Server logs with filtering
- Music player with real-time SSE updates
- Feature toggle management (Unleash + env var fallback)

### Backend Quality
- Zod input validation on all routes
- Rate limiting (API 100/min, auth 20/15min, write 30/min)
- Centralized error handling (AppError + asyncHandler + errorHandler)
- Request logging middleware
- Auth readiness health contract at `GET /api/health/auth-config`
  (includes `clientId` and generated `authorizeUrlPreview`, without secrets)
- Guild automation execution locking is Redis-backed and fail-closed when lock
  infrastructure is unavailable
- 421 tests (361 backend + 60 frontend), 96% statement coverage

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+, FFmpeg, Discord Bot Token
- PostgreSQL + Redis (or use Docker)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky.git
cd Lucky
cp .env.example .env    # Configure DISCORD_TOKEN, CLIENT_ID, DATABASE_URL
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # Add credentials
docker compose up -d    # Starts postgres, redis, bot, backend, frontend, nginx
docker compose logs -f  # View logs
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev:bot         # Bot with hot reload
npm run dev:backend     # Backend with hot reload
npm run dev:frontend    # Vite dev server

npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run lint --workspace=packages/frontend
npm run lint --workspace=packages/backend
npm run type:check      # TypeScript validation
npm run test            # Backend tests (Jest)
npm run test:coverage   # With coverage report
npm run format          # Prettier
```

### Local Database Bootstrap

`db:*` scripts now pin Prisma config explicitly via
`--config prisma/prisma.config.ts`, so local runs no longer depend on implicit
config discovery.
`npm run db:generate` now injects a safe fallback `DATABASE_URL` only for
client generation, so CI build jobs can run `build` without a database secret.

`npm run db:migrate` runs a guarded wrapper:
- default path: `prisma migrate dev --config prisma/prisma.config.ts`
- fallback path (local-only): only when Prisma returns the known legacy
  bootstrap failure (`P3006` with missing `guilds`), it runs
  `prisma db push --accept-data-loss`, marks historical migrations as applied in
  lexicographic order, then re-runs `migrate dev` to verify state (and when the
  same legacy shadow-db signature persists, it finalizes with
  `prisma migrate status`)
- all other migration errors fail normally without fallback

For isolated git worktrees, run `npm install` inside each worktree before
`npm run type:check` to keep local package resolution pinned to that worktree
and avoid stale shared type declarations leaking from another checkout.

Backend lint now runs in strict mode across all backend routes and middleware.
Use `npm run lint:full --workspace=packages/backend` for explicit backend-only
verification in CI or local checks.
Sonar main-gate reliability checks are strict on new code: use deterministic
string sorting (`localeCompare`), keyboard-accessible UI interactions for
clickable controls, and bounded parsing logic for user-facing text handling.

### Remote Deploy (No SSH)

```bash
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh main
# or
npm run deploy:homelab
```

Triggers the GitHub `Deploy to Homelab` workflow, waits for completion, and shows failed logs.
Webhook deployments pin `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=lucky` and resolve the active
compose working directory, so runs from `/repo` target the existing homelab stack.
The webhook container now executes deploy commands from
`/home/luk-server/Lucky` to match the live compose stack metadata.
Interrupted deploys now auto-recover stale lock directories on the next run.
Deploy workflow smoke checks now require `GET /api/health/auth-config` to return
`status=ok` with no warnings (including healthy Redis/auth-session flags).
Deploy workflow now also validates the `/api/auth/discord` redirect contract:
`302` to Discord authorize URL with expected `client_id` and same-origin
`redirect_uri=https://lucky.lucassantana.tech/api/auth/callback`.
Both deploy smoke checks now retry during rollout until the new backend
containers are serving the expected contract.
CLOUDFLARED tunnel restarts now mount config from `CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG_DIR`
instead of shell `$HOME`; use a canonical host path like
`/home/luk-server/.cloudflared` to avoid deploy-context mount drift.
For deploy incidents where webhook trigger succeeds but API remains `502`, run
the operator diagnostics:

```bash
./scripts/homelab-diagnostics.sh server-do-luk
```

The diagnostics output is sanitized and includes Lucky container state, backend
log tail, and auth health/OAuth checks.

Vercel note: `vercel.json` runs `npm run db:generate` before `build:shared` and `build:frontend` to ensure Prisma generated client files are present during cloud builds.
For hosted frontend deployments, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend API origin
(example: `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`) to avoid auth/API loop misrouting.
Last.fm dashboard connect links use this same API base, so split-origin
deployments should keep `VITE_API_BASE_URL` aligned with the public backend.
Authenticated frontend shell routes now bootstrap guild selection globally, so
the server selector is populated immediately after login without requiring a
visit to `/servers` first.
Guild auto-selection prioritizes the first server where Lucky is already added;
if none are bot-added, the dashboard keeps no selected server and shows a clear
selection/empty guidance state.
Server selector empty/error states are split:
- `No accessible servers found` means authentication worked but no authorized
  guilds matched your access policy.
- `Could not load servers` means auth/session/network/upstream fetch failed;
  use `Retry` or `Re-authenticate` from the selector.
- `Select a Server` in dashboard after login means no bot-added server was
  auto-selected yet; open `/servers` to invite Lucky to additional servers.
Without `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, frontend uses same-origin `/api` for
`*.lucassantana.tech` hosts and `api.luk-homeserver.com.br` for
`*.luk-homeserver.com.br`.
When `WEBAPP_FRONTEND_URL` includes multiple origins, use comma-separated values
(example: `https://lucky.lucassantana.tech,https://lukbot.vercel.app`); backend CORS
accepts all configured entries while OAuth/Last.fm redirects use the first origin.
Set `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI` to the exact Discord OAuth callback URL registered in the
Discord Developer Portal (example: `https://lucky.lucassantana.tech/api/auth/callback`).
For this release cycle, keep the frontend-host callback as canonical in Discord.
Set `WEBAPP_EXPECTED_CLIENT_ID` to the production Discord app id to make
`/api/health/auth-config` return `degraded` on credential drift.
Set `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` to your public backend/API origin when you expose API routes
through a dedicated host. Use an absolute URL (for example,
`https://lucky-api.lucassantana.tech`).
When `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` is temporarily missing, `/api/health/auth-config`
now validates OAuth origin against the current request origin fallback so deploy
smoke checks can confirm live routing contract correctly.
Bot `/lastfm link` URLs prioritize `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` and fall back to the
origin of `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI` when backend URL is not set.

## Slash Commands

### Music
`/play` `/pause` `/resume` `/skip` `/stop` `/queue` `/volume` `/seek` `/lyrics` `/shuffle` `/repeat` `/clear` `/remove` `/move` `/jump` `/history` `/songinfo` `/autoplay`

### Download
`/download` `/download-audio` `/download-video`

### General
`/ping` `/help` `/exit`

### Twitch
`/twitch add` `/twitch remove` `/twitch list`

### Server Setup
`/serversetup template:forge-space [mode:apply|dry-run]`
`/serversetup template:criativaria [mode:apply|dry-run]`

Setup behavior:
- `mode` is optional and defaults to `apply`
- `forge-space` creates the base channel/role layout and welcome embed
- `dry-run` mode previews planned setup changes without mutating guild state
- `criativaria` validates fixed channel/role mappings and continues with warnings
  when required IDs are missing
- Preserves existing guild visual identity (icon, splash, and banner)
- Uploads `assets/criativaria-banner.png` to staff assets once and reuses the
  Discord CDN URL in embed templates
- Applies idempotent upserts for moderation, automod, guild settings,
  auto-messages, embed templates, custom commands, role exclusivity, and Twitch
  seed configuration

### Management
`/guildconfig capture` `/guildconfig plan` `/guildconfig apply`
`/guildconfig reconcile` `/guildconfig status` `/guildconfig cutover`

## Centralized Guild Automation

Lucky now supports declarative server automation for guild operations:

- Manifest-backed desired state persisted in database
- Shadow capture and drift planning against live guild state
- Safe auto-apply for non-destructive changes
- Protected operations (deletes/permission tightening) require explicit opt-in
- Native Discord onboarding mapping (`fetchOnboarding`/`editOnboarding`) is first-class
- Cutover role cleanup targets only external bots explicitly flagged with
  `retireOnCutover: true` in parity manifest data
- Automation API precondition failures (`no manifest`, `capture required`,
  `apply already running`) return actionable 4xx responses
